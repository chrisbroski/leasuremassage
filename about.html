<h2>About Me</h2>
Stacy Leasure graduated from Irene’s Myomassology Institute in 2006. Since then she has worked in chiropractic offices and spas providing massage for rehabilitative care and stress relief.

Irene’s played a huge part in her life and she considers herself a “forever student.” In 2009 Stacy became an apprentice at Irene’s for both the hands-on practical application of massage and in applied myomassology. In 2012 Stacy started assistant teaching in Thai Ayurvedic Massage, Table Thai, Hot Rock Massage and Flowing Bodywork. After all Stacy’s hard work and dedication, she was offered the position of Irene’s Alumni Association Director which she gladly accepted in 2019. 

In 2016 Stacy was honored with the Auntie Margaret Humanitarian Award from the World Massage Festival for all her volunteering in the massage world. 

Stacy has extensive experience in therapeutic massage, hot rock massage, thai massage and swedish massage. She also enjoys providing prenatal massage, labor massage and infant massage. 

Stacy is continuously expanding her knowledge on massage therapy and is currently pursuing an assistant teaching position with Trunamics.
